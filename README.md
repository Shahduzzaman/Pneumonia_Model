# X-RAY_CovPneuSense
**AI-driven lung X-RAY image analysis for early detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia.**

---

## Project Description
**X-RAY_CovPneuSense** is an AI-powered deep learning model designed to detect **COVID-19** and **Pneumonia** from lung X-ray images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze lung patterns and classify medical images, assisting healthcare professionals in faster and more reliable diagnosis.

### Key Features
-  Deep learningâ€“based detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia  
-  Fast and scalable for real-time medical support  
-  Supports radiologists and clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning
